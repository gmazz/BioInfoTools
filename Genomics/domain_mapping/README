We use bedtools to do the intersection between the domain's bed file and the file reporting the 
position of the genes.

The files containing the domains need to be located in the subdir:
/data/domains/
The files containing the genome has the name:
/data/genome/genome_data_hg38_simple.bed 
The results are located in the subdir:
/data/results/
