The pdb_template_fetch.py file is useful to obtain the closest PDB templates for a given NCBI database (in PDB_data) via BLAST.

The template candidate are then parsed and quality control is performed for a given set of Cutoffs (Structure resolution, R-free, etc.).

The pdb_template_candidates_list.py returns a list of quality candidates, sorted by importance, without making a selection of the best (as for the other script.)
This second file is useful to evaluate a change of template for any reason.
