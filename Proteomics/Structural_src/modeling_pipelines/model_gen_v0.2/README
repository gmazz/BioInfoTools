Overview:

	The run_pipeline.sh file runs iteratively the modeling for all the instances (modeling directories) present in the directory named "running" 
	It copies all the files required for modeling, from the "mod_pipeline" directory and clean the directory from these files, once the process 
	is completed. Each process is sent to a different screen, which is named after the specific instance*, thus is possible to easily track the
	state of each instance*.

General structure:

	mod_pipeline : contains all the files required for the pipeline
	run_pipeline.sh : bash script to run the pipeline on separate screens (one for each instance*)
	utility_scripts : some useful scripts
	running : directory containing the instance* to run. 

*An instance is represented by a directory containing two files:

1) A MSA including the template sequence (directly extracted from pdb!) and the sequences to be modeled. The template sequence should be the
entry of the MSA.

2) The PDB tamplate

Notes: The protein sequence of the template within the MSA should be exactly the sequence of the template's structure.
If there is even a single mismatch between template's sequence and structure, the whole modeling process in which that template 
is involve will miserably fail.
